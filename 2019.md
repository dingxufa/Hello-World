A penny-pincher is someone who does not spend very much money, who watches every penny,

spendthrift is someone who spends all of their money, who doesn't save their money.



To "**put something aside**" means to save it for a later time.



Some people might say,"I'm a penny-pincher,"but no one would say,"I'm a spendthrift," because it's sort of an insult, it's a negative expression.



Well I said,"In my family, there are penny-pinchers and spendthrifts, and everything in between," meaning, there are people between the two opposites of saving all your money, and spending all your money, everything in between.



Well, my brother Frank **has a reputation for being stingy**, and to be "stingy" (stingy) is the same as being a penny-pincher, but it's definitely a negative expression, it's not a positive adjective.

You say someone is stingy, **means even if they should spend money,** they don't.



The expression,"**to save up,**"two words, that verb means basically **the same as "to save**." It's like a lot of two-word verbs where you have a preposition like "up" that comes after the verb.

It's more to **give emphasis**.

So I'm going to save to buy a new car.

I'm going to save up, to buy a new car.

They mean basically the same, but the "up" gives it a little more emphasis.





Well, I say that "I bet my brother has a lot stashed away." "**To stash (stash) away**" is a verb which means to save, but **usually to save a large amount of something**, and you're saving it for a long period of time.

"**I have some money stashed awa**y," means I have money that I'm going to use in the future.

The noun,"stash" means that money that you have.

So,"Here's my stash" means here's my money that I'm saving.



I say that my brother is "careful with money." "To **be careful with money" means of course that you watch what you spend,** that you don't just buy things because you want to, and you see it and you like it.



"**On the other hand**" is when we are going to give in a story a different example, or an opposite example.

Usually, you hear those two expressions together,"On the one hand, I don't want to go to the movie,""**On the other hand**, I have a free ticket, so I should go," - so when you're comparing two different things that are different or opposite.



a **high-roller** is an expression that comes from gambling.

someone who's a high-roller is someone who spends a lot of money, either by gambling or by going out and spending their money to buy different things.





Well I say that,"**It's not that my brother is a big spender, or a high-roller, it's just that he's not very careful with money.**"Notice the expression,"It's not that, it's just that".

When we are explaining something to someone and you want to give them the reason why something happened, or why someone did something, you can start by giving them something that isn't true, "It's not that I don't like Tom Cruise, it's just that I think he's not the best person to marry." That would be an example, it's not that, it's just that.

So when you say,**"It's just that," you're giving the real reason - the true reason, and when you say,"It's not that," you're saying what isn't true - what you don't believe is true.**





The expression,"to **think twice**" (twice), two times, to think twice means to be careful - to think about something before you make a decision, before you take an action.



The expression,"to **be generous to a fault**," (fault) means basically that they **are very generous**, that they help everyone that they can.

He's generous to a fault, he likes to help everyone who needs help, and that's what the expression means here.



"Am I a penny-pincher, or a spendthrift?"and I say,"I**'m a little of both,**" means of course, I'm partly a penny-pincher and I'm partly a spendthrift.



# 157: Taking the Bus.

>I just moved to L. A. and don't have a car.
>
>Everybody says that you can't get around this city without one, but I wanted to prove them wrong.
>
>I asked my neighbor to take me to the downtown bus station so I could try taking the bus home.
>
>She thought I was crazy, but gave me a ride.
>
>When I got there, I went inside and got a bus schedule.
>
>I looked at the map and figured out that I needed to take three buses to get home.
>
>The fare was $1.75 per ride and I could buy a single ticket, a booklet of 20, or a bus pass.
>
>I would need transfers, too, to change buses.
>
>I took my map and went outside to wait at the bus stop for the Number 8 bus.
>
>Soon, it pulled up and I got on.
>
>I gave my ticket to the bus driver and took a seat.
>
>At the stop where I needed to get off, I rang the bell, the bus stopped, and I got off.
>
>I waited for the next bus.
>
>I waited and waited.
>
>A man who was also waiting for the Number 14 bus said that it wasn't unusual for the bus to be delayed.
>
>It finally got there and I found out that the bus had broken down along the route and they had to get another bus to take its place.
>
>By this time, I was getting pretty tired.
>
>Maybe getting a car in L. A. wasn't such a bad idea.
>
>



I have to say that this is definitely a fictional story – a **made up** story

I had to **make this story up.**

**the bus  pulled up and I got on.**

At the stop where I needed to get off, I rang the bell, the bus stopped, and I got off.



I used to take a bus all the time when I **lived back** in Minnesota



"**To get around" – two words – means to be able to go from one place to another – not a specific place.**

For example, you wouldn't say, "I need to get around from my house to the beach."When you use the verb "to get around,"you mean in general, getting from one place to another within the city.

"How do you get around?""I have a car,"or "I take the bus."





"To **prove someone wrong,**"of course, means to show them that they are wrong – to give them evidence that they are wrong.

You can prove someone wrong.

You can prove someone right.



We sometimes call these stations – these places – "terminals" (terminal).

A "terminal" is where something ends, but when we talk about a bus terminal, or a train terminal, those are usually for buses and trains that are going to other cities – to other places.



And, of course,"to **give someone a ride** (ride)" means that you drive them there.

They go with you in your car.





Well, the "fare" (fare) for the bus ride was $1.75, one dollar, seventy five cents.

And, of course, the "**fare" is the amount of money that you have to pay**.

We use the word "fare" for buses.

We use it for airplanes.

"How much is the airfare?""How much is the bus fare?" "How much is the train fare?"– **anything that has to do with transportation.**

We even say,"How much is the cab, or taxi cab, fare?" It's the price that you pay.





A "**booklet**" (booklet) is a small book, but it's not a book that you read.

A "booklet,"**in this case, is just a collection of tickets that you can use for the bus**.

We can use booklet as something you do read.



Another thing that you can get to ride a bus is a "pass" (pass).

**A "pass" – you pay usually, a certain amount of money for a week or a month.**

And **you can use the bus as much as you want during that time.**

There are bus passes, there are train passes



bus station  / bench / shlter



I'm waiting for **number 8 bus**.



We would say, the car "pulled up" to you.

"The bus **pulled up and I got on**,"meaning I entered the bus.



And someone told me that "it wasn't unusual" for the bus to be delayed.

**"It wasn't unusual" means it's usual.**



**"It wasn't unusual for the bus to be delayed." "To be delayed" (delayed) means to be late – not to be there on time.**

It's delayed.



"When we say an automobile or a bus, or any sort of machine "**breaks down,"we mean it stops workin**g.



This bus broke down along the route.

The "route" (route) – which some people pronounce "route" – the "route" is the places where the bus travels.

**A "route" is like a path.**

It is a place where something goes, travels across.



someone says,**"It wasn't such a bad idea**," what they're saying is it's a good idea.
