# chapter1

> 
>
> 
>     In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the
>     University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the
>     course prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my
>     studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland
>     Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India
>     at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had
>     broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had
>     advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy's
>     country. I followed, however, with many other officers who were in
>     the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in
>     safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new
>     duties.
>         
>     The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had
>     nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade
>     and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal
>     battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail
>     bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I
>     should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not
>     been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who
>     threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to
>     the British lines.
>        
>     Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had
>     undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to
>     the base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already
>     improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to
>     bask a little upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric
>     fever, that curse of our Indian possessions. For months my life was
>     despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became
>     convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board
>     determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to
>     England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the troopship Orontes, and
>     landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my health
>     irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government
>     to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.
>        
>     I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as
>     air--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day
>     will permit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally
>     gravitated to London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers
>     and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for
>     some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless,
>     meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably
>     more freely than I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances
>     become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis
>     and rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a
>     complete alteration in my style of living. Choosing the latter
>     alternative, I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and to
>     take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive
>     domicile.
>        
>     On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at
>     the Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and
>     turning round I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser
>     under me at Bart's. The sight of a friendly face in the great
>     wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In
>     old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine, but now
>     I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be
>     delighted to see me. In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him to
>     lunch with me at the Holborn, and we started off together in a
>     hansom.
>        
>     "Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?" he asked in
>     undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.
>     "You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut."
>        
>     I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded
>     it by the time that we reached our destination.
>        
>     "Poor devil!" he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my
>     misfortunes. "What are you up to now?"
>        
>     "Looking for lodgings," I answered. "Trying to solve the problem as
>     to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable
>     price."
>        
>     "That's a strange thing," remarked my companion; "you are the second
>     man to-day that has used that expression to me."
>        
>     "And who was the first?" I asked.
>        
>     "A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the
>     hospital. He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not
>     get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had
>     found, and which were too much for his purse."
>        
>     "By Jove!" I cried, "if he really wants someone to share the rooms
>     and the expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a
>     partner to being alone."
>        
>     Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass.
>     "You don't know Sherlock Holmes yet," he said; "perhaps you would not
>     care for him as a constant companion."
>        
>     "Why, what is there against him?"
>        
>     "Oh, I didn't say there was anything against him. He is a little
>     queer in his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far
>     as I know he is a decent fellow enough."
>        
>     "A medical student, I suppose?" said I.
>        
>     "No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is
>     well up in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I
>     know, he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His
>     studies are very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of
>     out-of-the way knowledge which would astonish his professors."
>        
>     "Did you never ask him what he was going in for?" I asked.
>        
>     "No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be
>     communicative enough when the fancy seizes him."
>        
>     "I should like to meet him," I said. "If I am to lodge with anyone, I
>     should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong
>     enough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in
>     Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How
>     could I meet this friend of yours?"
>        
>     "He is sure to be at the laboratory," returned my companion. "He
>     either avoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from
>     morning to night. If you like, we shall drive round together after
>     luncheon."
>        
>     "Certainly," I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other
>     channels.
>        
>     As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn,
>     Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I
>     proposed to take as a fellow-lodger.
>        
>     "You mustn't blame me if you don't get on with him," he said; "I know
>     nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally
>     in the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not
>     hold me responsible."
>        
>     "If we don't get on it will be easy to part company," I answered. "It
>     seems to me, Stamford," I added, looking hard at my companion, "that
>     you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this
>     fellow's temper so formidable, or what is it? Don't be mealy-mouthed
>     about it."
>        
>     "It is not easy to express the inexpressible," he answered with a
>     laugh. "Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes--it
>     approaches to cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a
>     little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of
>     malevolence, you understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in
>     order to have an accurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I
>     think that he would take it himself with the same readiness. He
>     appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge."
>        
>     "Very right too."
>        
>     "Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the
>     subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking
>     rather a bizarre shape."

>

>        
>     "No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we

>     ground to me, and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone

>     us with a test-tube in his hand. "I have found a re-agent which is
>     precipitated by hoemoglobin, and by nothing else." Had he discovered
>     a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features.
>        
>     "Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said Stamford, introducing us.
>        
>     "How are you?" he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength
>     for which I should hardly have given him credit. "You have been in
>     Afghanistan, I perceive."
>        
>     "How on earth did you know that?" I asked in astonishment.
>        
>     "Never mind," said he, chuckling to himself. "The question now is
>     about hoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this
>     discovery of mine?"
>        
>     "It is interesting, chemically, no doubt," I answered, "but
>     practically--"
>        
>     "Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.
>     Don't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains.
>     Come over here now!" He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his
>     eagerness, and drew me over to the table at which he had been
>     working. "Let us have some fresh blood," he said, digging a long
>     bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood
>     in a chemical pipette. "Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a
>     litre of water. You perceive that the resulting mixture has the
>     appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than
>     one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to
>     obtain the characteristic reaction." As he spoke, he threw into the
>     vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a
>     transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany
>     colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the
>     glass jar.
>        
>     "Ha! ha!" he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a
>     child with a new toy. "What do you think of that?"
>        
>     "It seems to be a very delicate test," I remarked.
>        
>     "Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and
>     uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles.
>     The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this
>     appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test
>     been invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who
>     would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes."
>        
>     "Indeed!" I murmured.
>        
>     "Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is
>     suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His
>     linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon
>     them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit
>     stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many
>     an expert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have
>     the Sherlock Holmes' test, and there will no longer be any
>     difficulty."
>        
>     His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his
>     heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his
>     imagination.
>        
>     "You are to be congratulated," I remarked, considerably surprised at
>     his enthusiasm.
>        
>     "There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would
>     certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there
>     was Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of
>     Montpellier, and Samson of new Orleans. I could name a score of cases
>     in which it would have been decisive."
>        
>     "You seem to be a walking calendar of crime," said Stamford with a
>     laugh. "You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the 'Police
>     News of the Past.'"
>        
>     "Very interesting reading it might be made, too," remarked Sherlock
>     Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his
>     finger. "I have to be careful," he continued, turning to me with a
>     smile, "for I dabble with poisons a good deal." He held out his hand
>     as he spoke, and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar
>     pieces of plaster, and discoloured with strong acids.
>        
>     "We came here on business," said Stamford, sitting down on a high
>     three-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his
>     foot. "My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were
>     complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I
>     thought that I had better bring you together."
>        
>     Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms
>     with me. "I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street," he said, "which
>     would suit us down to the ground. You don't mind the smell of strong
>     tobacco, I hope?"
>        
>     "I always smoke 'ship's' myself," I answered.
>        
>     "That's good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and
>     occasionally do experiments. Would that annoy you?"
>        
>     "By no means."
>        
>     "Let me see--what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at
>     times, and don't open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I
>     am sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I'll soon be right.
>     What have you to confess now? It's just as well for two fellows to
>     know the worst of one another before they begin to live together."
>        
>     I laughed at this cross-examination. "I keep a bull pup," I said,
>     "and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at
>     all sorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another
>     set of vices when I'm well, but those are the principal ones at
>     present."
>        
>     "Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?" he asked,
>     anxiously.
>        
>     "It depends on the player," I answered. "A well-played violin is a
>     treat for the gods--a badly-played one--"
>        
>     "Oh, that's all right," he cried, with a merry laugh. "I think we may
>     consider the thing as settled--that is, if the rooms are agreeable to
>     you."
>        
>     "When shall we see them?"
>        
>     "Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we'll go together and settle
>     everything," he answered.
>        
>     "All right--noon exactly," said I, shaking his hand.
>        
>     We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together
>     towards my hotel.
>        
>     "By the way," I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford,
>     "how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?"
>        
>     My companion smiled an enigmatical smile. "That's just his little
>     peculiarity," he said. "A good many people have wanted to know how he
>     finds things out."
>        
>     "Oh! a mystery is it?" I cried, rubbing my hands. "This is very
>     piquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. 'The
>     proper study of mankind is man,' you know."
>        
>     "You must study him, then," Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.
>     "You'll find him a knotty problem, though. I'll wager he learns more
>     about you than you about him. Good-bye."
>        
>     "Good-bye," I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably
>     interested in my new acquaintance.









1. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps（部队） had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy's country.

corps这个单词是特种部队的意思：A corps is a part of the army which has special duties. 形式上是复数，但意义上是单数。

这句话可以拆分成：I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and my corps was already deep in the enemy's country. 时态上，“我”知道消息的时候，我的部队已经穿过山隘，所以这里用到的是过去完成时态，而我的部队当时的状态是深入敌境，所以这里跟I learned的时态一致，是一般过去时态～这句话的意思是：登陆孟买后，我了解到我的部队早已经前进穿过了山隘，深入敌国境内。



2. Here I rallied, and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little upon the verandah（走廊）, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse of our Indian possessions

   

   be struck down by enteric fever是“染上伤寒”，后面的that curse of our Indian possessions不是一个从句哦，这里是在补充说明“伤寒”的，curse和possession都是熟词生义，curse 是“祸害，祸因”，possession是“领地，殖民地”，是在说伤寒是印度殖民地的祸根。

   这里还涉及到了同位语，fever=that curse of our Indian possessions

这句话的意思是：在这里，我恢复振作，已经好转到能在病房走动，甚至还能在阳台晒会太阳，这时我染上了风寒，这个我们印度领地的祸根

3. I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as air -- or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be.

kith与kin读起来是不是很顺溜呀 neither kith nor kin 相当于于“无亲无故”，这两个词是reverse rhyme哦（词首的辅音和元音相同），我们在写作中也可以多使用押韵词。对rhyme感兴趣的小伙伴可以多看看相关的资料～

neither…nor也是我们经常能看到的表达，表示“既不…也不…”
an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day 在这里是指“收入11先令6便士的人”我们将后部分的内容改写成or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day （which） will permit a man to be. 是不是更好理解啦，will...在这里是从句成分哦，which指代前面的an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day，重新组织一下就是an income of...will permit a man to be free~

这句话的意思是：我在英国无亲无故，所以就像空气一样自由——或者一天收入11先令6便士的人能有多自由我就多自由。



4. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated（被强烈地吸引） to London, that great cesspool（污水坑） into which all the loungers and idlers（游民懒汉） of the Empire are irresistibly drained.

under such circumstances表示“在这种情况下”。后面不是that引导的从句哦，而是在补充说明London，that后面的部分可能不太好理解，调整一下就是 great cesspool which all the loungers and idlers（游民懒汉） of the Empire are irresistibly drained into. 这样是不是清楚很多啦。

这句话的意思是：在这种情况下，我自然被吸引到了伦敦这个大污水坑，大英帝国所有的游民懒汉都不可抵挡地流向这里。



5. "You don't know Sherlock Holmes yet," he said; “Perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion. ”

为什么是“不愿意和他做一个长年相处的伙伴”呢？not care 不是“不介意”吗？
care是“介意”的意思，care for有“愿意；照顾”的意思。举个例子 调戏小姐姐的时候可以说 Care for a drink? 愿意喝一杯吗？那么这句话的意思是：你还不认识夏洛克·福尔摩斯吧，他说，也许你不愿和他长期作伴。

作者借华生的朋友小斯坦弗之口侧面介绍福尔摩斯，“他就是想法有点怪……是个很正派的人……他的研究很杂乱……对科学未免有点太执着……”听起来确实是很神秘呢



6. When it comes to beating the subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape."

when it comes to表示“一谈到，一提到”，后面自然而然是接名词或者动名词，beating在这里就是动名词呢~

rather作为程度副词，意思是“相当”，等同于very，quite。
这句话的意思是：后来他甚至在解剖室里用棍子抽打尸体，这可是相当奇怪的事了。"



7. …a fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.
  前面work已经与at搭配使用了，所以这里不涉及work up的用法。up at的组合很少见呢，但是既然作者这么写了，我们就这样来理解：up有“上面的”意思，up at大概就是指在...上面，文中就是表示（化学实验室）在医院上面，想表达出一种楼层感吧，给读者以视觉的想象~当然直接用at也是没问题哒~
8. He either avoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning till night.

这句话的意思是：他要么就几个星期不去，要么就从早到晚在那里工作。

我们来区分一下either…or和neither…nor的用法哦~
either表示两者其中的任意一个，either…or则意为“要么…要么…；不是…就是…”
neither表示两者中没有一个，即全否定，neither…nor则意为“既不…也不…”



9. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects.

out of：出于…（的动机）
a spirit of inquiry：求知精神

这句话的意思是：我可以想象他拿一小撮植物碱给他的朋友尝尝。你要知道，这并不是出于什么恶意，只不过是出于一种求知的精神，为了了解这种药物的不同效果罢了。



10.  "Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the subjects in the dissecting-rooms（解剖室） with a stick, it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape.

「bizarre」：very strange or unusual.
「take the shape」：呈现...的形状，以…的形式出现，那么rather a bizarre shape也就是十分奇怪的形式了

这里说的是小斯坦福对于福尔摩斯的评价，追求科学的精神固然是没错，But！在解剖室里用鞭子抽打尸体就实在是太诡异了吧，过头了（push to excess）！

用到的结构是**give sb credit for sth** 赞许的意思

That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.这里的should not aware 

should有竟然的意思,表示出乎意料  appeared to be such an...  to me可以理解为插入

在19世纪，一个有知识的人居然不知道地球绕着太阳运行的道理，实在令我匪夷所思



Of contemporary literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing.

know next to nothing of sth 对..一无所知

confide in sb  向sb吐露心声

a  point-black question  截至了当的问题
